    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chicken Parmesan, a favorite in Italian-Brazilian-style restaurants, is surprisingly easy to make at home. One common issue with restaurant versions is the excessive sauce and cheese that can turn the dish into a soggy mess. However, with this homemade method, you can enjoy a perfectly crisp texture. The secret is to skip placing sauce under the chicken cutlets, opting for a light drizzle on top. If you're a sauce lover, don't worry; you can always serve extra on the side. This recipe also stands out by using a combination of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone, and real Parmesan cheese for a delicious twist.</p>

    <p>A clever trick in this recipe is adding grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, creating an additional layer of flavor. The chicken breasts are fried to a golden brown before being transferred to a baking pan. Here, you'll add just the right amount of sauce, cheese, and herbs - not too much to overwhelm the dish. This balance ensures that the Chicken Parmesan retains its delightful crispness and doesn't become a soggy, cheesy mass.</p>

    <p>In summary, making Chicken Parmesan at home allows you to enjoy a restaurant-quality dish without the common problem of excessive sauce and cheese. This recipe's careful approach of keeping the breading crisp and using a variety of cheeses elevates the dish to a whole new level. With the added touch of grated Parmesan in the breadcrumbs, you'll savor a flavorful, satisfying Chicken Parmesan that's easy to prepare in your own kitchen.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>
        <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
